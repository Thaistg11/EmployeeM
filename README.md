## Future Improvements

While **EmployeeM** provides full functionality for employee management, role-based access, and department theme customization, it‚Äôs important to note that the **main focus of this project has been the backend and database layer**.  

The application prioritizes:  
- Secure authentication and authorization  
- Role-based data access  
- Efficient database operations with ADO.NET  
- Scalable and maintainable backend architecture  

As a result, the **frontend and overall user experience (UX/UI)** were not the primary focus in this version.  

Planned improvements for future releases include:  
- A more modern and user-friendly interface  
- Improved navigation and visual design   
- Interactive elements and better accessibility support  
- Streamlined theme customization options  

These enhancements will make the system not only **powerful in functionality** but also **intuitive and enjoyable to use**.
